# MATLAB Implementation of OFDM system

Step-wise implementation of a downlink OFDM system with one Base Station and 2 UEs, Channel Estimation using Max Likelihood, Repetition Coding, and 16QAM modulation.

The system uses 20 subcarriers, 5 frequency selective channel taps, and includes a tradeoff study between Bit Error Rate and Spectral Efficiency w.r.t. channel estimation pilots.

This system achieves a diversity gain of 3 and spectral efficiency of 1.667.
